For complete instructions see the "Installation" section of README.md.

You can install this plugin as a standard Mahara artefact plugin, with one
important exception: For this plugin to work correctly (work at all) you need 
to edit the htdocs/view/blocks.php core Mahara file.

You have to add a string to javascript array around line 152
(look for $javascript = array_merge($javascript, $blocktype_js['jsfiles']);),
so it looks like this:

$javascript = array_merge($javascript, $blocktype_js['jsfiles']);

if (class_exists('PluginArtefactCloud')) {
    $blocktype_cloud_js = array('artefact/cloud/lib/datatables/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js',
                                'artefact/cloud/lib/datatables/js/dataTables.bootstrap.min.js');
    $javascript = array_merge($javascript, $blocktype_cloud_js);
}

Alternately, you can apply the patch file "htdocs_view_blocks.patch"

    cd /path/to/your/mahara
    patch -p0 < htdocs/artefact/cloud/htdocs_view_blocks.patch

If the plugin stops working after a Mahara upgrade, you may need to reapply the patch.
