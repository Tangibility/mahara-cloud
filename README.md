# mahara-cloud

This is a cloud artefact plugin for Mahara e-portfolio system. It allows integration of several cloud services into Mahara.

## Description

This plugin provides users with several new block types, one for each cloud service enabled.
Users can place these blocks into their pages in order to display a selection of items
from their account on a cloud service. They can also download items from some of the cloud
services, into their Mahara file storage area.

## Requirements

Your site admin will need to have an API key for each of the cloud services you want to
enable. Additionally, each of your users will need to have a user account in any of the
cloud services they want to use.

The configuration page for each cloud blocktype contains instructions about how to register
for an API key on each service.

## Installation

1. Create a directory under your Mahara installation: `htdocs/artefact/cloud`
2. Copy the contents of this repository into that directory.
3. Apply the patch file "htdocs_view_blocks.php", to hack the htdocs/view/blocks.php file to include the necessary Javascript. (Or make the change manually, as described in "install.txt")
    cd /path/to/mahara
    patch -p0 < htdocs/artefact/cloud/htdocs_view_blocks.patch
4. Run the normal Mahara upgrade process.
5. Log in to your Mahara site as an admin.
6. Go to "Administration -> Extensions -> Plugin administration"
7. Under the "Plugin type: blocktype" list, find the list of blocktypes that start with "cloud/".
8. Hide each cloud blocktype that you don't wish to use by clicking "Hide" next to it.
9. Click the configuration icon next to each cloud blocktype you will be using, and fill in the necessary configuration information. You may need to register an API key with the cloud provider. Each configuration page has instructions on how to do so.

## Usage

1. Log in as a normal Mahara user.
2. Go to "Content -> Cloud services"
3. Use the controls on this page to log in to any of the cloud services you wish to share in your Portfolio. You may need to register a user account with the given cloud service.
4. Now when you create a page, you can drag a blocktype for that cloud service into the page, and set it to display a selection of items from that cloud service.
